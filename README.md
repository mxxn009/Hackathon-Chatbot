# Hackathon-Chatbot

This is a Chatbot which we made for booking tickets, it can respond but currently it cannot store user information, feel free to contribute.

To use the chatbot:
1. Make a virtual environment using the command

  > python3 -m venv venv

2. Activate the virtual environment using the command:

  > . venv/Scripts/activate.bat (for windows)

3. Install dependencies
   
   > (venv) pip install Flask torch torchvision nltk

5. Install nltk package

   >  (venv) python
      >>> import nltk
      >>> nltk.download('punkt')

```
hello my name
```
